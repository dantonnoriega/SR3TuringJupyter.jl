### Initialize

```
julia> ]                                        # Actvate Pkg mode
(@v1.6) pkg> activate .                         # Activate pkg in .
(SR2StanPluto) pkg> instantiate    # Install in pkg environment
(SR2StanPluto) pkg> <delete>       # Exit package mode
julia>
```

If above procedure fails, if present, try to delete the Manifest.toml file and repeat above steps. As mentioned above, these steps are only needed the first time.
