# Statistical Rethinking (3rd edition) with Julia

Here is the port of code examples from amazing [Statistical Rethinking book](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) 
to the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).

[Turing](https://turing.ml/stable/) is used for Bayesian modeling and [Julia Plots](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/) for graphics.

Notebooks are generated with `julia-1.10` and `quarto`. Full list of dependencies is in [Project.toml](https://github.com/dantonnoriega/SR3TuringQuarto.jl/blob/main/Project.toml).
