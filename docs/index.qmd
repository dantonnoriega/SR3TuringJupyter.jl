Here my attempt to port the R code blocks from the draft 3rd edition of Richard McElreath's amazing book, [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/), to the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).

-   [Turing](https://turing.ml/stable/) is used for Bayesian modeling and [Julia Plots](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/) for graphics
-   Notebooks are generated with `julia-1.10` and `quarto`
-   Full list of dependencies can be found in [Project.toml](https://github.com/dantonnoriega/SR3TuringQuarto.jl/blob/main/Project.toml)
-   See the [`README.md`](https://github.com/dantonnoriega/SR3TuringQuarto.jl/blob/main/README.md) for run requirements
